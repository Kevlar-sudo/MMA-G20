## Description
Matching U apps aim to build a bridge for adults, who want to explore and start their love journeys. Matching U focuses on helping users find the best partner based on three main considerations: age, location, and interests. When the new user opens the Matching U app, they can easily enter personal information and preferences. Then, the user will be able to like or dislike the recommended potential matches provided by the app algorithm. Furthermore, the user will be able to view or edit their profiles anytime.
