## Description
Matching U apps aim to build a bridge for adults, who want to explore and start their love journeys. Matching U focuses on helping users find the best partner based on three main considerations: age, location, and interests. When new users open the Matching U app, they can easily start by entering personal information and preferences such as age, gender, and interest to create their own profile. Then, with the unique user ID and name, they are able to log in to the Matching U app. Next, there are several actions that the user can take, including editing and viewing their profile, viewing other users' profiles, liking and disliking other users, deleting their own profile, and logging out. The matching U app will use the algorithm to recommend potential matches to the current users.
